# Handling Missing Keys in JSON Response in Dart
This example demonstrates a common error in Dart when working with JSON responses: attempting to access a key that doesn't exist.  The code includes both the buggy version and a corrected version showing how to robustly handle potential missing keys.

## Bug Description
The original code directly accesses a JSON key without checking its existence. If the key is missing, it throws an exception. This can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The solution involves checking for the key's presence before accessing it, using methods like `containsKey` or null-aware operators (?.)
